# Description

This repository contains the implementation, tests, and experiments for a multi-objective optimization (MOO) method, hereafter referred to as **Ellipsoid**.
Specifically, the goal of this method is to achieve good performance in the "**many-objective**" case (i.e., when M > 5).

# How to use the material

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlouguzzoni1/Tesi_Magistrale.git
```

- Enter the project directory

```bash
cd Tesi_Magistrale/Code/Env
```

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the Python packages needed for operation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


You should now be ready to work in the virtual environment.

- To import the files from their respective directories and start working, run the `import_test_files.sh` script

- When you are finished working in the environment and want to save the changes you made to the files, run the `export_test_files.sh` script

- To clean up your test and development environment, run the `clear_test_files.sh` script


*Note: This is still a beta version, more will be added soon.*
